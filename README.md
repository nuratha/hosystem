## Hosystem
A web-based hospital management system for booking appointments. Made for a school project.

### How to run:
* Install a PHP-based web server solution such as XAMPP.
* Clone this repository to the htdocs folder.
* Open phpmyadmin and create a new database named "hosys"
* Import hosys.sql

Note: Dummy data in hosys.sql is to ensure accounts can't access data from other accounts + to have several readily available doctor and hospital options.

Made using PHP, HTML and Tailwind CSS.

Dependencies can be found in package.json.
